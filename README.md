\\implementing a container with the intention of creating another outcome variable while maintaining the requierd 100%
\\ peramiters should be false, void, null or found as a failure for logic loops that fail a stability continuity argument instead they can be archived and cycled using the new js deployment although instabilitys still exist in the authentication code when multiple agents share identical keysets \\ the circumvention will be adding a weak-medium unshareable variable that does not get stored such as the memory index of the agents or prefferably the raw input bus used
\\core trust persistancy code is a must for development agents
\\\ more parameters coming \\\\\ suggestions welcome
\\ housekeeping for existing branches of repositorys by virtual enumeration until the tor tunnel or opensql tunnels can be converted
